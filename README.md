================
Initial version written by Joe Jaworski (http://www.joejaworski.com/weather/)

Additions made by Jack Farley (https://github.com/bytesnz/wproweather)

Developing a custom version using metric system and json output (https://github.com/orsa-unige/vproweather/tree/metric-and-json).

Metric system and json output are currently suppoted for -x, -l and -t options.
